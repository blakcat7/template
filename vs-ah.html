                    <h3>Vertical Sliding Screen - Arab Health (Ministry of Health)</h3>
                    <p>Fractal Systems have developed a unique Sliding Screen X-Ray system.</p>
                    <p>It enables the viewer to scan what is behind the screen in an X-Ray visual. The user can control the movement of the Sliding Screen wirelessly through a tablet or from a touch kiosk. The Sliding Screen can be controlled manually as well.</p>
                    <p>The Sliding Screen reveals a digital vision of a physical element at the backdrop. The Screen scans like a magnifying glass which brings the static backdrop into life in motion.
                        It acts like an X-Ray Scanner which displays information about the product features, with the opportunity to include different forms of media - text, images, video, 3D elements etc.</p>
