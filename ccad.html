                    <p>Using very thin, specially designed, signal cable the motor unit can move the objects up and down with precision. Each light ball can be adjusted individually in height, speed, color and luminance. Bespoke array creations of controllable motor units with light balls can generate complex three-dimensional abstract shapes and visual effects.</p>
